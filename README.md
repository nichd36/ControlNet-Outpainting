# Outpainting with ControlNet

## Overview
A simple experiment with ControlNet in order to perform outpainting. The .ipynb file contains a link to run it in Google Colab. Make sure to use a session with a GPU such as T4.

## Note
The 'streamlit' branch contains streamlit code. Deployment of the 'streamlit' branch was canceled due to insufficient resources, particularly the lack of GPU availability.

## Future Improvement
Based on the examples, a lot of improvement can still be implemented. Some actions can be performed such as:
1. Using more powerful resources
2. Implemented better weights
3. Look into the possibility of improvement by using various image augmentation techniques.
